                </div>
                <p class="lead">Growing up, she would sew us clothing like sweaters, socks, hats, and pajama bottoms.
                    As a teenager, I never wanted to wear anything she made, because I wanted to wear something I could purchase,
                    something that the cool kids at school were wearing. However, as I have grown into adulthood, I've come to appreciate
                    the gift my mom has. My mom is the type of individual who can follow any sewing pattern and present you with
                    a beautifully and sturdy made item. She also has the gift to look past patterns and sew pieces from memory, from intuition.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">My mom is the kind of human who uses her skills to help other people. She would
                    rather make you a gift than buy one. She cherishes homemade ones the most. Recently as the world
                    found itself unwell and people social-distancing, my mom decided to protect people by making face
                    masks. Utilizing the fabrics in her sewing room, she has made masks for the family and friends.
                    As a way to raise awareness about my mom's masks that she made with love, I create this website
                    so people could have one.
